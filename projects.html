            <h3 align="center">Multi Purpose Wind Turbine</h3>
            <h4>Project Type : </h4><p>Major</p><h4>Duration:</h4><p> Nov 2019- Mar 2020 </p><h4>Medium of Project :</h4>
            <p>Aerodynamics</p><h4>Description :</h4>
            <p >Wind turbine project is about generating power with the help of the wind generated by
                vechiles at highways and vechile rush areas. As it named multi purpose the second feature
                of the project is about filtering air with HCC sheets. With the use of high voltage dynamoes, 
                the power generation will be takes with rotation of fins motion will be converted to requitred power needed to run filters.

            <h4>Project Type : </h4><p>Minor</p><h4>Duration:</h4><p> 15 Nov 2020 - 25 Nov 2020 </p><h4>Technology Used :</h4>
            <p>Java</p><h4>Description :</h4>
            <p >The Game of Life is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes at each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the status of that cellâ€™s adjacent eight neighbor cells. Neighbors of a cell are the cells that touch that cell horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

            <h4>Project Type : </h4><p>Minor</p><h4>Duration:</h4><p> 15 Feb 2021 - 19 Feb 2021 </p><h4>Technology Used :</h4>
            <p>CNF</p><h4>Description :</h4>
            <p >This is a one week Socket programming project, I have coded a given application using TCP/UDP iterative server that can concurrently handle multiple clients. This command user interface project is done alone using Python.This project helps to numerous tasks that a networking application does for making a web server.
                In building this project, I am familiar with HTTP.</p>
